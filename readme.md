# Sketch Bound with Box

This plugin takes the selected layer and draws a matching rectangle, ideal for creating a box around previously loose elements.

## Padding

Padding can be added to the rectangle, which is added to all four sides.

## Move

You have the choice to move the contents (where the rectangle is drawn at the top left of the selected layer, and the selected layer is moved down and right by the padding amount), or move the box (where the rectangle is moved up and left by the padding amount).
