# Sketch Bound with Box

This plugin takes the selected layer(s) and draws a bounding rectangle.

This tends to be useful for creating a box as an alignment tool, or as a quick method of creating a box around elements as part of a design.

## Padding

Padding can be added to the rectangle, which is added to all four sides.

## Move

You have the choice to move the contents (where the rectangle is drawn at the top left of the selected layer, and the selected layer is moved down and right by the padding amount), or move the box (where the rectangle is moved up and left by the padding amount).

## Square

You can now force the box to be square, based on the longest dimension. This will use the selected Move option to align the contents with the box.

## Installation

1. Download and unzip Sketch Bound with Box.
